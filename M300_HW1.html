<h2> About Me: </h2>
<dd> My name is Matthew Burley. I am currently a 5th year senior here at WSU and I am studying applied mathematics and quantitative economics. I'm from Spangle, WA which is a very small farm town about an hour north of Pullman where I graduated in 2018. I spent my first two years of college at Spokane Falls Community College where I also played baseball and studied chemical engineering, but found myself liking math the more I studied it. I also took a couple economics courses and found myself loving what I was learning. So, I ended up changing my major and I am liking what I'm studying so much more! Looking forward to a great semester and learning more about programming! </dd>
